-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--                              Message from CEO Cindy
-- Good morning, I need some help preparing a presentation for the board meeting next week. #
-- The board would like to have a better understanding of our growth story over our first 8 months.
-- This will also be a good excuse to show off our analytical capabilities a bit. -Cindy

-- YOUR OBJECTIVES: 
  -- Tell the story of your companyâ€™s growth, using trended performance data 
  -- Use the database to explain some of the details around your growth story, and quantify the revenue impact of some of your wins
  -- Analyze current performance, and use that data available to assess upcoming opportunities
  
  -- --------------- MID COURSE QUESTIONS
      -- 1. Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our business. 
			-- Could you pull monthly trends for gsearch sessions and orders so that we can showcase the growth there? 

	  -- 2.	Next, it would be great to see a similar monthly trend for Gsearch, but this time splitting out nonbrand 
            -- and brand campaigns separately. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell. 

      -- 3.	While weâ€™re on Gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand, and pull monthly sessions and orders split by device type?
            -- I want to flex our analytical muscles a little and show the board we really know our traffic sources. 

      -- 4.	Iâ€™m worried that one of our more pessimistic board members may be concerned about the large % of traffic from Gsearch. 
            -- Can you pull monthly trends for Gsearch, alongside monthly trends for each of our other channels?


-- STEP 1: Find the first website_session_id for relevant sessions.
-- STEP 2: Identify the landing page url of each session.
-- STEP 3: Counting pageviews for each session, to identify "bounces". 
 -- (If have more than one pageview then its a non-bounce  but only on landing page but did nothing elas, its a bounce)
-- STEP 4: Summarizing total sessions and bounced sessions by Landing page.

/*
8. Please quantify the impact of our billing test, as well. Please analyze the lift generated from the test
(Sep 10 â€“ Nov 10), in terms of revenue per billing page session, and then pull the number of billing page sessions
for the past month to understand monthly impact.
*/
-- ------------------------------- STEPS TO FOLLOW ----------------------------------------------------------------
-- STEP 1: Select all pageviews for relevant sessions
-- STEP 2: Identify each relevant pageview as the specific funnel step
-- STEP 3: Create the session-level conversion funnel view
-- STEP 4: Aggregate the data to assess funnel performance

select
billing_version_seen,
count(distinct website_session_id) as sessions,
sum(price_usd)/count(distinct website_session_id) as revenue_per_billing_page_seen
from (
select 
	website_pageviews.website_session_id,
	website_pageviews.pageview_url as billing_version_seen,  -- that is old billing page is /billing and new billing page /billing-2
	orders.order_id,
    orders.price_usd
from website_pageviews
	left join orders
		on orders.website_session_id = website_pageviews.website_session_id
		where website_pageviews.created_at >'2012-09-10' -- gotten from the assignment
		and website_pageviews.created_at < '2012-11-10'  -- gotten from the assignment
		and website_pageviews.pageview_url IN ('/billing','/billing-2')
) as billing_sessions_w_orders
group by 1;



# Executed
# billing_version_seen	sessions	revenue_per_billing_page_seen
# /billing				657				22.826484
# /billing-2			654				31.339297


-- New billing page ( "/billing-2" ) produces $31.34 per billing page seen
-- Old billing page ( "/billing" ) produces   $22.83 per billing page seen
-- So the difference or the lift is $8.51 per billing page view

####### Next look at how many sessions we had when someone hits the billing page

select
	count(website_session_id) as billing_sessions_past_month
from website_pageviews
where
	website_pageviews.pageview_url IN ('/billing','/billing-2')
    and created_at between '2012-10-27' and '2012-11-27' -- these are the past months
    
# Executed
-- We have 1,193 sessions from the past month on the billing page
-- Recall, the lift is $8.51 per billiing sessions.
-- 1,193 x $8.51 = $10,152.43
-- The value of the billing test over the past month is $10,152.43.
