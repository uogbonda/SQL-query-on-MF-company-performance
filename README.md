# SQL-query-on-MF-company-performance

## MF Company
The board would like to have a better understanding of the company's growth story over our first 8 months. Since our source "gsearch" with campaign-"nonbrand" has been doing so well, focus on this. Quantify the revenue impact of the A/B 50-50 testing on "billing" page and "billing-2" page. 

## Objective
* Detailed story of company's growth using monthly trended performance.
* Analyze current performance, provide conversion funnel from home and Lander1 page.

## Tasks
* Pull monthly trends for gsearch sessions and orders so that we can showcase the growth there.

* Deep dive into "nonbrand", and pull monthly sessions and orders, then split by device type.
* Pull monthly trends for "gsearch", alongside monthly trends for each of our other channels.
* Pull session to order conversion rates, by month.
* Estimate the revenue that the A/B testing  from June 19th to July,28th using nonbrans sessions and revenue. Calculate the incremental value.
